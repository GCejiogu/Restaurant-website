I'm developing a website for fictional restaurant "Quick chop". 
I'm building the website using HTML and styling with CSS (No framework).
Some of the features of CSS used so far in this project include but not limited to the following:
CSS Grid - helps in layout styling
hover - to add a hover effect to elements.
box-shadow - used to create a 3d-like visual effect. And so many others.
I also want to mention that I got the icons from "heroicons" (no subscription required). 
You can get Icons from Bootstrap icons,fontawesome and others.
For this project, I used google fonts(free).
I will continue to add more features and eventually complete the service and order pages of the website.
